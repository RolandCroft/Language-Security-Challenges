# Mining Developer Security Knowledge and Discussions of Programming Languages from Open Source Repositories

This repository acts as an online appendix for the paper _"An empirical study of developers' discussions about security challenges of different programming languages"_, which was publised in the Empirical Software Engineering journal 2022, and presented at ESEC/FSE 2022. This repository contains all data, models and results produced from our research for the purposes of future work or potential reproduction.  

We note that these datasets and results are not perfectly reproducible due to their nature: the data is constantly being updated/changed/removed/added in these online communities.  

An explanation of this repository is as follows, and further details are provided within each folder:  

### Appendix
Additional resources and artefacts used in the research.
### DataSets
The datasets obtained from RQ1 and examined in RQ2-6.
### Document_Metrics
Document metrics and metadata used for RQ5.
### Topic_Models
The optimal topic models used for analysis in RQ3 and RQ4.
